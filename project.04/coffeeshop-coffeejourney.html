        <h1 class="large-font"><b>Cultivation</b></h1>
        <p>Many factors are important to the growing and harvesting of the coffee plant; temperature, precipitation, soil properties and altitude. Breeding and care of the plant, correct fertilization and appropriate plant protection are also very important.

            The tropical coffee plant makes many demands on its environment. Geographical conditions, temperature, sunlight, rain, wind and soil compositions must be perfectly matched to ensure excellent quality and harvest. Here Arabica and Robusta varieties seek different conditions.
            
            The average temperature for the beneficial culture of Arabica coffee should be between 18 and 25 degrees. The temperature should not exceed 30 degrees and should not constantly fall below 13 degrees. Robusta has a higher compatibility. It can withstand higher temperatures on average, around 26 degrees Celsius. In insufficient humidity, this plant can also show sensitive reactions to high temperatures.</p>

        <h1 class="large-font"><b>Harvest</b></h1>
        <p> Coffee plants give their first crop after three or four years. After six to eight years, the trees reach their maximum production capacity. The coffee tree needs a long time for its fruit to fully mature. After pollination, a period of six to eight months for Arabica, 9 to 11 months for Robusta, and 12 to 14 months for rare species Excelsa and Liberica.

            In fact, coffee harvesting can be done once a year. In the tropics, which do not differ greatly in terms of dry and rainy periods, it can bloom twice a year, and therefore a true harvest and an additional harvest can occur. Since not all fruits ripen at the same time, the harvest period normally consists of a period of 10 to 12 weeks. But the main part of the harvest period focuses on a period of six to eight weeks.
            
            Only ripe coffee cherries are picked individually by hand for the best coffee. In fact, it is a very demanding job in terms of time and work, but it guarantees high quality. This harvesting method is used for Arabica coffee, especially since it is prepared wet.</p>

        <h1 class="large-font"><b>Coffee Drying</b></h1>
        <p> The purpose of this process is to dry the beans in the coffee cherries until they reach a peeling consistency without residues. This method is the oldest method as it is a practical application of nature. This method can be applied in all regions where the air is dry and warm enough.

            Wet method; It is primarily preferred in regions where there is not enough water. However, the type of plant, mechanical equipment and labor cost also determine the choice of processing method. Robusta coffee is prepared dry with some exceptions. Arabica is also prepared dry in Brazil and Ethiopia.
            
            For the drying process, they spread the coffee cherries, which have almost the same maturity, on the floors paved with concrete or cobblestone. In smaller plantings, drying racks are also used. The wire surfaces forming the shelves are covered with woven fabrics, on which the coffee cherries dry.
            
            The covered fabric layer should not be too thick so that the coffee cherries do not rot. The fruits must be constantly moved and their direction must be changed. The product left to dry must be protected against rain and temperature fluctuations. It takes three to five weeks for the coffee cherries to dry out and have a residual moisture of 12%. A ripe, freshly plucked coffee cherry consists of 50-60% water. If the coffee cherry is shaken and the bean inside makes a sound, it indicates that the appropriate drying degree has been reached.</p>

        <h1 class="large-font"><b>Coffee Roasting</b></h1>
        <p>According to the desired taste and aroma, coffees of different origin, type and quality are mixed in accordance with each other. Regardless of the philosophy of the roaster, this process can be mixed either before roasting or after each has been roasted according to its origin. Since coffee is a natural product and is exposed to many external factors and cannot always be obtained in every type and quality, great skill must be possessed in order to always offer the same good product to the consumer as usual.

            Roasting is the dry heating of coffee beans, normally at atmospheric pressure. The actual roasting process starts with a roasting temperature of 100 degrees and ends at 200 - 260 degrees depending on the condition of the beans. What happens during roasting: The water in the coffee beans evaporates. Due to the high internal pressure and roasting gases formed by water evaporation, the beans reach twice their existing volume. The outer shell of the coffee bean separates and falls off.
            
            The kernel changes color, from a soft green to yellow, from yellow to brown, and from light brown to dark brown. Fats can come out regardless of the degree of roasting. As a result of a number of chemical first and secondary reactions, a unique coffee aroma is formed. With the help of gas chromatograph examinations, more than 800 aroma components have been detected so far. The cells of the core – closed and in a syrupy consistency – contain, among others, 1-2% carbon dioxide and small amounts of carbon monoxide, which, depending on the degree of scorching, disperse quickly or slowly out of the cells. During roasting of raw coffee beans – also called Penetration – they lose weight by 11-20% according to the water content of the raw coffee and the degree of roasting. In other words, 110 to 200 grams of organic and inorganic components are released in each kilogram of raw coffee, depending on the roasting process. The roasting of the coffee can be carried out in intermittent or continuous operations, where the roasting gases are recycled as energy savings.
            Roasting heat can be transferred to the product to be roasted by contact, purely or predominantly by convection. Frequently used roasting processes; Chargen roaster – either in roasters with a peeling system or in fluid bed dryers. Continuous roasting process; Here, the transportation and roasting of the coffee takes place on the drums that rotate on their axis, which is a transportation system inside. At the end of the roasting process, the roasted product is normally cooled with air. However, cooling with water can also be done, where the roasting process is abruptly terminated.

            Roasting is initiated between temperatures of 350-370F. At the end of the roasting period, the temperature reaches 425-450F. (10 -16 minutes) During the process, various chemical reactions occur in the coffee beans and the true flavor of the coffee is revealed. <br> <br>
        
            Changes in Coffee Beans During Roasting; <br>
            * Loses some of its caffeine. <br>
            * The flavor and aroma of the kernel is revealed. <br>
            * The core loses 75% of its moisture content and 16-22% of its weight. <br>
            * The core expands physically. <br>
            * Color changes from green to brown. <br>
            * The sugar in the bean caramelizes and the oil rises to the surface.</p>
